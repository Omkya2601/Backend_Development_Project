# Backend Developer Assignment — Final Project (Using Provided Templates)

This project uses the exact HTML templates you provided (`temp1.html` and `interestcompounded.html`) and adds one additional solved problem per template, keeping the CSS and layout structure intact.

Files:
- temp1_problem1.html  — Original Trigonometry template (Sec C + Cot A, 7-24-25 triplet)
- temp1_problem2.html  — New Trigonometry problem (Base=9, Perp=12 → Hypotenuse=15; Sin A + Cos A = 7/5)
- interestcompounded1.html — Original Compound Interest template (12000 → 20736, 3 years, r=20%)
- interestcompounded2.html — New Compound Interest problem (5000 → 5788.125, 3 years, r=5%)
- colourCode.css       — Stylesheet referenced by templates (placeholder; templates have inline styles too)
- arrow.png            — Placeholder image (replace with actual arrow image if you have)
- interesticon.png     — Placeholder image (replace with actual interest/triangle icon if you have)
- index.html           — Navigation page to open each solved problem

How to run:
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).
3. Click any problem link to open the rendered template pages.
4. Replace `arrow.png` and `interesticon.png` with your actual images (same filenames) if/when you upload them.

Notes:
- I preserved the templates' structure and CSS usage; I only replaced numbers/variables/solution blocks and added new problem blocks.
- If you want full fidelity with exact original external CSS you had, replace `colourCode.css` with your original file. Currently it's a safe placeholder to ensure the link doesn't break.
